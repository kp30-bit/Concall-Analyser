# Concall Analyser Frontend

React frontend for the Concall Analyser application.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will run on http://localhost:3000 and proxy API requests to http://localhost:8080

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with the production-ready files. The Go backend will serve these files.
